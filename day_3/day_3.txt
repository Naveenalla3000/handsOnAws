Security Groups
- virtual firewall for your EC2 instances
- security at the protocol and port access level
- all outbound traffic and 
  no inbound traffic,
- You can modify the rules for a security group at any time
- Security groups are stateful (If you allow an incoming traffic on port 80, the outgoing traffic on port 80 will be automatically allowed.)
- You can’t block specific IP addresses using a security group
- Instance can have multiple Security groups.
- Security group rule allows CIDR, IP, and Security Group as destinations.


Network Access Control List
- (ACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic 
  in and out of one or more subnets
- Inbound and outbound traffic is allowed or denied by default.
- can’t modify the rules for a network ACL until you disassociate it from the subnet
- network ACLs are stateless (If you allow an incoming port 80, you would also need to apply the rule for outgoing traffic)
- you can block specific IP addresses using a network ACL
- Subnet can have only one NACL.
- Network ACL rule only allows CIDR as a destination.

storage services in aws:
  1. s3 various buckets


storage types in aws
  1. block storage(instace store)
  2. file storage
  3. object storage

  block storage(instace store)(EBS):
    - block staiorage
    - ssd
    - install os 
    - os create volumes
    - not sharable


  file stoage:
    - network attach server
    - can't install os on them
    - can sharable


  object storage:
    - first service in aws
    - everthing is object
    - web browser friendly protocals
    
  
  ec2 == ebs,ebs, != ec2
         |   |
         os  anything


**EC2 can have miltiple EBS
**EBS cannot have multiple EC2;
**EC2 and EBS are in the same AZ. 
                {{ EBS muilti-attach }}



Amazon EBS Multi-Attach


- general perpose
  - GP3
  - GP2
  **- max iops : 16,000;
  - increse the disk size get more iops.

Provisioned IOPS
  - IO2
  - IO1
  **- max iops: 64,000
  - you can decide Iops and pay for it.

  **- when we spin-up a EC2 instace, one EBS is automatically spined-up for us, but that EBS is root EBS(means that EBS will delete by termination of EC2 instace by default)


  snapchats:
    - EBS snapchats && DATA life Cycle Manager

    - snapchats lives in region not in one particular AZ.
    - snapchats can be use as AMI
    - snapchats stored in S3.
    - increamental updates (only the new changes will stored)


  Data Life Cycles:
    - auto create & delete the EBS & convert AMI
    - Data Backup (Audit)
    - update AMI

  Instace Store:
    - EC2 and EBS can be different mechines (attach with nack card)
    - instace stoage are in same mechine(same EC2 hosts)
      - physical attached
      - high performance
      - **lose all the data on shoudown



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Elastic file Storage:
  - linux vs windows
  - if the EFS and two EC2 instaces are in one VPC and
    another EC2 and
    also one on-prem client
    want to access the EFS 
    that can be do that, 
    only probem here is all should be in same Linux mechine.(because  NFS is only avaiable in LInux)
    NETWORK FILE SYSTEM for LINUX 


SIMPLE STOAGE SERVICE:
  - object storage
  - api access
  - bucket: container(PNG, MP4)
  - URL based access
  - default block all public access
  - S3 gataway endpoint vs internet gateway

  -** Universal Unique Name
  -** Trasfer Acceleration (improves the speed for uploda and download)
  - Events (SNS, SQS to process video)
  - version and Replication

  --*** S3 stoage class:
    depends on HOW FAST I WANT TO ACCESS THE DATA and HOW QUICKLY I WANT TO ACCESS THE DATA

    -- ** (3 AZ avaiability)
    
    1. S3-standard = default = general perpose = quickly access the data.
    2. S3-IA = Ai will replaces the objects 
    3. S3-one-zone-IA = 1-zone avaiability = singe digit milliseconds
    4. S3-standard-IA

    **90 days
    5. Glacier-instant-retieval = milliseconds
    6. Glacier-flexible-retieval = min to hrs for reteriveal of data 




Amazom FSx file system:


1. for LUSTER = high performance = Mechine learning
2. windows file system = 


AWS STORAGE GATEWAY:
  file gateway
  on your on-prem device install something know as storage gateway and this this storage gateway types
  (
    1. file gateway
    2. FSx
    3. volumes
    4. tape
  )

  AWS ELASTCI DISASTE RECOVERY
  - on-prem recovery
  - point in time recover
